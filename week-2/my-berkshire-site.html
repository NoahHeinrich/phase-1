ABOUT <doctype> and <html>:
***************************
The <!DOCTYPE> declaration must be the very first thing in your HTML document, before the <html> tag.
The <html> defines language for the current HTML page, we use "en" for english.

ABOUT <head> and its children used in this document:
****************************************************
The <head> element is a container for all the head elements, we use it for title and potential link to future script and css ressources. Head belong to the top of the document because it works as a part of the code browser is first checking. That's the reason why you often want to store useful links into the head such as librairies or stylesheets. Another important thing to remember is that your browser won't display the <head> contents of the document into your page.
The <link> tag to link to next week's stylesheet
The <script> tag for scripts in the future
The <meta> tag describe metadata within an HTML document: Meta data is data (information) about data, here, data is encoded with utf-8 naming standard.
The <title> tag defines a title in the browser toolbar, provides a title for the page when it is added to favorites, displays a title for the page in search-engine results

ABOUT <body> and its children used in this document:
****************************************************
The <body> tag defines the document's body (what browser will display after you read your page).
The <section> tag defines sections in a document, such as chapters, headers, footers, or any other sections of the document. Here we use it followed by <hr> to add a line
The <header> element represents a container for introductory content or a set of navigational links.

The <main> tag specifies the main content of a document. This document's <main> is divided into 3 parts:
-The list <section> (links of corporate articles),
-The advertising <article> (GEICO.COM add for car insurance),
-The contact <div> (mail info).
-(Dividing the page into 3 parts separated by <hr> tags is a nice choice because code will stay clear for future updates and maintenance and styling purposes.

The <ul> tag defines the beginning of a list, we use this tag to declare the beginning of the link list.
The <li> tag defines a list item, we use li to declare the beginning of every entry of the list.
The <article> tag specifies independent, self-contained content. Here we only use two articles, one for GEICO textual advertising and one for the contact.
The <img> tag is used to add an image, always use atribute scr="" inside the tag in order to link an image. Used to display GEICO logo.
The <p> tag defines a paragraph, used to display paragraphs in advertising, contact section and legal disclaimer.
The <hr> tag draws a horizontal line, used to separate sections.
The <br> tag add blank line. Used to separate a line in Legal disclaimer.
The <small> tag is used for copyrights information, used for the Berkshire copyright
The <summary> and his parent <details> tags are used to hide/show on click information on the HTML page. We thought that using HTML5 was a good oportunity to improve this on Berkshire's website.

Additionally:
************
The <b> tag is used to add a kind of "bold effect" to the type. It was used here name to emphasize the html look and feel. I think we will remove it when we start css.
The &nbsp; has been added in order to replace the &, which is not recognized by non-latin users.


REFLECTION:
***********
What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
-> Paul had worked with html in the past so he was pretty fluent with the process as you can probably tell.
Kyle learned a few new things from him and he found it very interesting to see the new things in action.

How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
-> Researching and using semantic HTML5 elements was a very edifying process.
Because we all have some previous experience with HTML, it's very interesting to compare old tags and new one.
For example, we learned about the new standards for <section> <article> <header> and <footer> which are very common HTML elements and are a good replacement for classes such as <div class="header">. Moreover, researching for HTML5 tags was a good opportunity to review basic HTML ones.

How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML).
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
-> We did well to keep formatting out of the HTML except for when we put a few things in bold to match the original website
And made one piece of text smaller in the bottom.
-> We tried to indent the code properly, and use the appropriate tags and HTML best practices such as comments and spacing for readability.

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
-> HTML is good for creating the architecture of a page and structuring its content and external resources.
-> HTML is bad for having advanced styling and interactivity.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°°
-> Paul: I Imagine I'm in country, made of areas, made of towns town, made of houses, mades of flats, mades of rooms, mades of square meters, mades of items and so on.. Just like russian dolls.
-> Kyle: I try to remember HTML by making note cards and practicing the writing as often as I can.
