#### We suggest using the relative path instead of the absolute path. Can you think of why?
**About relative and absolute paths:**

In order to remember what is the difference between absolute and relative path, it’s easy: an absolute path will always include de domain naim of a website, such as http://… when a relative link will directly point to... a path! On clicking a relative link, the web browser takes him to the location of the site and this is the reason why you can only use relative when linking contents of your own site. Absolute links will be used to link external ressources such as other websites.

#### What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?
**Phase 1: Information Gathering**

First of all a designer must understand who he works for and what are the corporate values the client wants to corroborate through the design of his project. It means the designer must have a deep understanding of both the field of expertise of the client and his audience in order to achieve his client’s goals.
That the reason why the beginning of the process is usually a meeting where the designer is asking as much questions as possible to the client.
A second step of creative agencies doing web design generally involve presenting a moldboard with appropriate references for the client, in order to understand what kind of project he needs and if you’re on the good direction. At this step you may also start to have many idea, that the reason why gathering must be done in an organized .txt file you want to keep update all along the project.
Next step, planning.

**Phase 2: Planning**

Referring to what you understood of your client needs: navigation, degree of expected pixel perfectness, responsiveness you have to start considering what technologies will need to be implemented.
At this phase you have already sketched a site-map in order to have an idea of the amount of work required by each part of the project. It’s important to understand that some clients are going to need basic things that won’t require much time and some others will want more complex implementations such as CMS or APIs. An other important though about client is that, often, they don’t event know what they need so you have to teach them what is a CMS and the interest of using it for example.
Once you have worked on all those points you should have an overall idea of how long the whole process of building the client dream app will take and you can start organize your time.

**Phase 3: Design**

Target audience is one of the key factors taken into consideration. Regarding to the aim of the website, the look-n-feel should be totally different. For example, a one-page site build for a teen-ager music band will use different visual codes than a website designed for U.S ambassy.

Then, the designer is going to use a prototyping tool, such as photoshop, or sketch in order to go from the mock-ups to the wireframe step. For this purpose, he will create several prototypes of the site, including some details and ideas he can have about the code (JS/CSS most of the time). It's important that developers and designers collaborate on the design process so they can both keep on eye on the potential constraints one solution can imply. Once the prototype is ready, generally wireframes, the development can begin…

**Phase 4: Development**

The developmental is the step where the web site itself is built. Teams generally start by building an index followed by a "shell" for the interior pages. Shell can be understood like a template for the content pages of the site and contains the navigational structure of the site. Once the shell has been created, your designer will take your content and distribute it throughout the site, in the appropriate areas such as images, typos, css and so on.

**Phase 5: Testing and Delivery**

At this point, your web designer will attend to the final details and test your web site. They will test things such as the complete functionality of forms or other scripts ensuring that your web site is optimized to be viewed properly in the most recent browser versions. A good web designer is one who is well versed in current standards for web site design and development. Valid code means that your site meets the current web development standards – this is helpful when checking for issues such as cross-browser compatibility as mentioned above. Then, it is time to deliver the site with a FTP program is used to upload the web site files to your server.

Other final details include plugin installation for analytics and SEO purposes. Basically adding javascript tags that will help your web site achieve higher rankings in the search engines and track your visitors.

**Phase 6: Maintenance**

For clients that prefer to be more hands on, and update their own content, there is something called a CMS. With a Content Managing System, your designer will utilize online software to develop a database driven site for you. A web site driven by a CMS gives you the ability to edit the content areas of the web site yourself. You are given access to a back-end administrative area, where you can use an online text editor. Other maintenance type items include regular site backups, WordPress upgrades, additional plugin installation, etc.

#### What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
**My site primary goad is being my creative coding vitrine. Allowing users to interact with various kind of contents such as showing my work and my implication in the community:**

**1. Finest web works presented as products, maybe:**

  1. Applications
  2. Scripts
  3. CSS wizardries
  4. Websites
  5. Design templates
  6. Tools
  7. ...

**2. Link to blog article sumarry**

  1. posts summary -> post content

**3. About me (img+text)  and link in order to get in touch with me:**

  1. Twitter
  2. Mail
  3. Linkedin
  4. Github?

#### What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
Considering my site as a portfolio I’d say my audience is a mix of **front-end designers**, **developers**, **business people and wider IT community**.
My site is addressing them as an audience aware of coding, using technical appropriate langage instead of pseudo-communicant approach.

#### What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site?
**Scrolling down** in order to discover the work list should be the first action when coming to my site. Work list should always start featuring my latest work.
Also as the main component of the page, work list, must be well designed to occupy page space and attack visitor eye by using lovely placeholder image/icon for each project. An important thing is keeping in mind last work always have to be featured first, but only finest works have to be part of the list.

#### Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
**On one hand, first time visitor:**
He should check my latest work because your last work, even if not your favorite always show you are up to date with fresh front-end frameworks and latest technologies. Then, navigate to other works if they want to know more about my previous works.

**On the other hand, used visitor:**
He should have an easy access to links to get in touch with me without needing to scroll. ( Also, maybe link to the blog)

#### What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
As industry’s technologies and methodologies advance making websites and web apps becoming more complex.
Fifteen years ago, users were interacting with static contents because of the basic technologies and fabrication processes. Nowadays, thanks to new technologies, the user is exposed to various, rich and interactives experiences, making the web project success hinging on one thing: how does users perceive it.
Unconsciously, every time an user becomes a visitor of your website, he is asking himself, how easy is the website to use, how pleasant, and how much he is enjoying navigating on your website.
Design and UX are asking those questions and trying to find the most appropriate solutions in order to provide to the user a decent, fresh and up-to-date experience while browsing the site.

#### What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
UX solve problems! It is basicaly how a user feels when interfacing with a website, a web application or desktop software. User experience design consists in making the experience as good as possible for the user by designing it.
UX designers study and evaluate how users feel about a system. looking at such things as ease of use, perception of the value of the system, site heatmaps, utility, efficiency in performing tasks and so forth.
Users have been accessing websites in an increasing number of ways: mobile devices, a vast landscape of browsers, different types of Internet connections. UX designers have to think a new, cross-device and cross-browsers ways to create their projects, one project working on all plateforms will always be better for the client to work with and also easier to maintain than X projects for X platforms. qED Valuable.

#### Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
Reflecting on User experience was tedious because I worked one year as an Ui/Ux designer and there are so much things to say.
