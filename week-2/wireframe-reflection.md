#### What is a wireframe?
A wireframe *(or page schematic, screen blueprint)* is a is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website. This can be realized by a non-technical person but it is usually a designer work. Most of the time, wireframing consists in developing the graphical part of the human-machine interface. The wireframe depicts the page layout orarrangement of the website’s content, including interface elements and navigational systems, and how they work together.

#### What are the benefits of wireframing?
Wireframing focuses and benefits on:

**1. The range of functions available:** helps the teams to have a global and visual understanding of every web component involved for the development of the project.

**2. The relative priorities of the information and functions:** architecting information of the page, usually using type sizes to create different levels of reading.

**3. The rules for displaying certain kinds of information:** Many web components are not statics, so wireframing is also aware of components behaviors. for example: “What happens when I :hover this part of the site?”

**4. The effect of different scenarios on the display:** A next step in wire framing consists in working on user scenarios, trying to imagine all possible navigations between the features of the site, how intuitive they are and how they can be made even more intuitive.

So basically, wireframing helps the teams to have a global and visual understanding of every web component involved for the development of the project.
It also helps to have an idea of how long and how expensive the development will be, and furthermore, to organise the time.
Finally wireframing give the visual tone of the project, and also some pieces of work to show to your client before you start building the project.

#### Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I enjoyed it a lot. Was very hard to stop trying to improve my wireframes and also to provide some “simple” output because the possibilities are neverending.
By the way, when I usually wireframe it’s for more complex things, such as web apps or complex desktops tools. Here the process took me two hours before I started to find something I found visually interesting, I'm not really sure it's good but it's just the first version!

#### Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
I went through the whole material before I started wireframing and also did a moodboard because having references is very helpfull when it comes to design.
So I kinda sticked to the “first” idea even if I was not properly the first I had.

#### What questions did you ask during this challenge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?
While I was wireframing I started thinking about how I can implement my site features using a front-end framework such as bootstrap in the next few weeks.
www.getbootstrap.com is both a good site and a very nice easy to use framework (I’m using everyday in my job).

#### Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
Finding the right moment to stop designing is an hard thing since you always want to find some better way to arrange the content of the page. Also, the more you design the wireframe the more you want it to look like a real website, starting to consider new features step after step. For me, it’s tedious to say “stop” when it comes to design because design is a pure iteration process.
