# 1.6 Your website

#### Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.
https://github.com/gastongouron/gastongouron.github.io

#### Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Visit the gitHub website, once on your github account landing page, simply click on “create new” symbolized by the + icon and then hover and click “New Repository“ option. After your are done naming your new repository and filled the few options of the form, you will be able to use a HTTPS link to clone it on your local environment.

#### Describe what open source means.
Open source mean that every possible part of the source-code in a project is available for the public. it means it can be modified and potentially improved by everyone able to bring improvements. Open source is something beautiful, the best OS in the world (UNIX) is open source itself. An other thing is that behind the simple concept of letting the code available to anyone, there is also a very collaborative approach that goes against the mainstream business approach of hiding every possible piece of valuable knowledge. Open source try to bring something more accessible to everyone by essence.

#### What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
In my humble opinion, open source is the only viable long-term approach for the software industry. World has changed since the post-industrial revolution era. Hundred years ago, in 1920, foremen and supervisors working on factorieswere gathering wheels and car-engines in order to build a full car and sell it. Casically, building a software is very different from building a car, you have to think about everything and it have to be perfect, because software works at 100% or 0%. Today, if you compare that car to an IT project, you can imagine that we dont just have to make a working car but to create the car of tomorrow. Once this is said, it’s easy to understand that it’s nonsense building teams of engineers with the same way of thinking and solving problems. What the IT industry needs is to integrate fresh people with creative new ideas and approaches in the IT teams so they will go further in building brand new services and products based on different people approach. So I think it's definitly not an utopia, open source is the new way to collaborate and build products, and belive it or not, it' real!

#### Assess the importance of using licenses.
Licenses are very useful for several reasons: First of all, it gives credit to people who is collaborating on the project. it also gives them rights to share and claim their work.
Secondary, it give the official permission to the world-wide community to collaborate or use your code if they want to. there are difference types of licenses regarding if ou want some permissive and simple lisence, if you are concerned about patterns or if you like sharing improvements.

#### What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
Before the challenge I had no idea what git was. Working around the differences between git and gitHub and how they can work together really helped me understand the power go both. The concept of working local then pushing changes online thanks to commands were very solidified for me, and I feel now comfortable doing this. I struggled with the pull-request because I first miss-filled the form and tried to pull my branch to DBC master branch instead of mine but I finally realized my mistake and cancelled the pull request. Aha.

#### Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I think this might be useful when filling the license part of the form, I decided to use MIT one because it’s the most simple and permissive referring to this website http://choosealicense.com/
