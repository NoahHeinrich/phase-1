1. position:static
The default positioning for all elements is position:static, which means the element is not positioned and occurs where it normally would in the document.
Normally you wouldn't specify this unless you needed to override a positioning that had been previously set.

2. position:relative
If you specify position:relative, then you can use top or bottom, and left or right to move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document.

3. position:absolute
When you specify position:absolute, the element is removed from the document and placed exactly where you tell it to go.
Let's move div-1a to the top right of the page:

4. position:relative + position:absolute
If we set relative positioning on div-1, any elements within div-1 will be positioned relative to div-1. Then if we set absolute positioning on div-1a, we can move it to the top right of div-1:

5. two column absolute
Now we can make a two-column layout using relative and absolute positioning!



How can you use Chrome's DevTools inspector to help you format or position elements?
How can you resize elements on the DOM using CSS?
What are the differences between Absolute, Fixed, Static, and Relative positioning? Which did you find easiest to use? Which was most difficult?
What are the differences between Margin, Border, and Padding?
What was your impression of this challenge overall? (love, hate, and why?)
