1. position:static
The default positioning for all elements is position:static, which means the element is not positioned and occurs where it normally would in the document.
Normally you wouldn't specify this unless you needed to override a positioning that had been previously set.

2. position:relative
If you specify position:relative, then you can use top or bottom, and left or right to move the element relative to where it would normally occur in the document.

3. position:absolute
When you specify position:absolute, the element is removed from the document and placed exactly where you tell it to go.
Let's move div-1a to the top right of the page:

4. position:relative + position:absolute
If we set relative positioning on div-1, any elements within div-1 will be positioned relative to div-1. Then if we set absolute positioning on div-1a, we can move it to the top right of div-1:

5. two column absolute
Now we can make a two-column layout using relative and absolute positioning!
