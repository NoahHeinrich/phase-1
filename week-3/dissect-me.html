What HTML5 tags have you used in this challenge and continue to return to often? Why?
*************************************************************************************
Tag such as <main>, <nav>, <header>, <article>, <section>, <aside> and <footer> are recurrently used in HTML challenges. Those new semantic tags have been added makes HTML more standardized and help developer teams by creating new web-schemes.

How do elements get laid out on a page? What is the order the browser uses to display elements?
***********************************************************************************************
Document object model (DOM) is a tree of DOM element and attribute nodes. In fact, browser reads page elements from the first character to the last. So first of all, your browser is going to understand you are working on an HTML document thanks to the doctype declaration. Then, after he met the <html> tag, he will understand the HTML document is starting. In the first part of the html document, a.k.a the head, your browser will read all tags and do apropriate operations, for example, when the brower reads the link to the stylesheet, he stops reading your html file, jumps to the CSS one and reads this CSS from the first character to the last one before going back to the initial html requested document. And so on.
The process made by the browser renderign engine is explained explicitly here:

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
*******************************************************************************************************************
The more you write html (and maybe code generally) you more you realize you may need certain short fragments of text again and again. A sublime snippet is a piece of stored text you can call using the associated tabTrigger text + tab button, and that will display pre-saved code in your editor, like magic. Those files with .sublime-snippet extention can be edited and users can also create new-ones referring to their needs.To proceed you have to do 3 things:
1. Add contents <content><![CDATA[Type your snippet here]]></content>
2. Add a scope <scope>source.html</scope>
3. Replace the tabTrigger by the name of your choice  <tabTrigger> HERE </tabTrigger>
Now, I'm planning to create a snippet for github markdown files including every possible flavored markdown styling content for the scope of md files.

What about research some shortcuts that already exist?
******************************************************
In order to find the allready existing sublime-snipets, those can be found, opened and edited on your Package/user directory. It is possible to download other developers snipets for sublime and use them as HTML5 boilerplates or to make yourself a new one.
